abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to draft NIH Data
  Management Plans (DMPs), but their quality and policy alignment require
  careful evaluation. This repository contains the code for our systematic
  assessment of Llama 3.3 and GPT-4.1 using both automated metrics and human
  expert review. See the project inventory for related resources, including the
  paper and dataset.
