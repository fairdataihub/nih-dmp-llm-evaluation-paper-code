Survey and Interview Example,element_5a,"The subitem questions and data making up the two proprietary scales used in the survey cannot be shared due to 
licensing restrictions. However, the computed measures resulting from these scales will be shared.
Sharing qualitative data such as transcriptions from interviews can potentially reveal sensitive information and identify 
individual participants. The potential for identification from interview transcripts is particularly high among industry 
professionals given the small population from which they are recruited and the inclusion of questions regarding 
organization-specific practices. The higher level of redaction needed to remove potentially identifying and sensitive 
information would substantially reduce the utility of transcripts in future analyses. Moreover, our prior experience and the 
attached letters of support indicate that confidentiality would be required for industry stakeholders’ full participation in 
this study. To ensure this group’s participation and honest responses, we will not share transcripts or coding summaries 
from industry stakeholder interviews.
Research participants will receive information about where and how data from this study will be shared during study 
enrollment procedures and in informed consent documents. Interview participants will be informed their data will be

check that the recruiting totals reported in the progress report are consistent with the data that has been 
deposited into NDA. The Office of Sponsored Programs will look for the NDA data DOIs when publications occur 
and will include that information in the annual progress report. The sequencing experiments will be conducted in 
the final year of the grant award, and those data will be submitted to and released by NDA prior to the end of the 
grant award.
Validation Schedule (this section is required by NIMH)
If funded, within 6 months of the Notice of Award date we will submit a Data Submission Agreement signed by 
the principal investigators and an institutional business official. We will also define and complete the Data 
Expected section of this project. Uploads of demographic, clinical, and raw structural MRI, 1
H fMRS and fMRI 
research data will begin at the second submission cycle deadline following the Notice of Award date. Subsequent 
data uploads will be harmonized, validated, and submitted biannually on the standard January 15th and July 15th
submission deadlines.
The NDA Validation and Upload tool will be used for quality control on newly collected phenotypic and clinical 
data every two weeks.",,
Genomic data from a non-human source,element_6,"The Office of Sponsored Programs at University X that will be administering this award has created a data

Validation Schedule (this section is required by NIMH)
Data will be validated using the existing pipelines at NeMO. We will submit each dataset once we reach a 
specific data freeze milestone. Upon each data freeze we will perform an initial phase of analysis that will 
culminate in the production of the cell × property matrix and associated metadata, at which point the dataset will 
be released. 
These milestones and target timelines include: 
End of 1st quarter of year 2: A full spatial single-cell ATAC-seq map of an entire mouse brain at P14. 
End of 4th quarter of year 2: An accompanying spatially-mapped single-cell RNA-seq dataset for a full mouse 
brain at P14, integrated with the ATAC dataset. 
End of 2nd quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell ATAC-seq map of each time point. 
End of 2nd quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell DNA methylation map for P14, integrated with RNA and 
ATAC datasets. 
End of 4th quarter of year 3: The complete spatial single-cell RNA-seq dataset for all time points, integrated with 
the ATAC data. 
End of 4th quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell map for all modalities, ATAC, RNA, and DNA methylation, 
integrated across modalities.",,
