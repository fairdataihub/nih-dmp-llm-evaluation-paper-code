,element_1,"Demographic, clinical, and MRI, 1 H fMRS and fMRI imaging data will be acquired from 110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls (described in detail in sections C.3 and C.4 of this application). All data will be deidentified prior to receipt by the repository, but the information needed to generate a global unique identifier for the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) will be collected for each subject.

1) Social media posts and comments: Approximately 300K publicly available social 
media posts (including images and videos) will be obtained through a third-party 
social media data mining vendor. The posts will be processed and given a unique 
identifier; comments will be linked with its associated post/identifier. All identifying 
information (e.g., names, social media handles or other user identifiers, websites) 
will be removed. These data will be categorized and coded (e.g. topic, sentiment, 
accuracy, use of personal narrative).
2) Survey data: The study will collect quantitative survey data from 500 young adult
participants (age 18-34) enrolled in an intervention delivered via Instagram, a 
popular social media platform. The survey instrument includes participant
demographic characteristics, and measures for all independent and dependent 
variables. Data will be recoded to characterize missing values and other data 
processing activities as needed. Each participant will also have their intervention 
group assignment (e.g., control group, intervention arm) documented. All data will 
be deidentified. 
3) User analytics: Program monitoring data such as views, comments, and “shares”
from the 500 participants enrolled in the intervention will also be collected with 
consent. This includes metrics related to each participant’s social media 
engagement within the intervention and control groups on a social media platform, 
as well as coded results of major themes and characteristics of participants’ posts. 
All identifiers (e.g., names, social media handles or other identifiers, websites) will 
be removed.

This is a secondary analysis of publicly available datasets comprising 1,000 subjects with Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) and 1,000 subjects without AD, aged 65-95 years. Primary data will be sourced from the 
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (clinical, cognitive data, MR imaging data) and from the 
OASIS-3 dataset (PET and MR imaging including multiple structural and functional sequences, along with 
related clinical, cognitive data, and APOE status), accessible through the Open Access Series of Imaging 
Studies (OASIS) database. This secondary analysis will yield novel insight into the functional properties 
of white matter (WM) circuits in normal aging and AD. This will involve examining local anisotropic 
correlation of the Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal on the voxel scale and templates for 
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) indices (fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean 
diffusivity) created using existing spatial normalization tools. For white matter/grey matter (WM/GM) 
connectivity, Fluorescence Optical Imaging (FOI) atlases in NIFTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology 
Initiative) format will be generated to delineate GM and WM connectivity, serving as normative data for 
future studies.

The project will generate high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read whole-genome sequencing data from a single human HeLa cell line, obtained from ATCC. Sequencing will be performed using the PacBio platform, which offers high-accuracy long reads suitable for resolving complex genomic regions. The total expected data output is approximately 700 megabytes (MB), capturing the complete genome of the HeLa cell line with high-resolution coverage.

This project is estimated to generate: (i) 30 Compound A analog’s design, production, characterization, and 
purification protocols. (ii) in vitro and cell-based assays of Compound A analogs (30 compounds to be 
tested). (iii) Substance stability and in vitro and in vivo toxicology (10 compounds, 6 WT mice per dose, 5 
doses), (iv) Pharmacokinetics (ADME) (3-4 compounds to be tested, 10 5xFAD mice per dose, 4 doses). 
(v) Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data (2-3 compounds, 15 WT or 5xFAD mice
per compound).

Demographic and clinical data will be acquired from 200 amyloid-positive, cognitively normal older 
adults with symptomatic insomnia. The types of clinical data include amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, 
phosphorylated tau, NPTX2, sTREM2, and NfL from CSF; Aβ, tau, and phosphorylated tau from 
plasma; and cognitive status assessments.

The study will generate multimodal data from 50 to 80 mouse subjects, combining electrophysiological, behavioral, and imaging modalities to investigate hippocampal function. The expected data types and estimated volumes are as follows:

Electrophysiology data: Neural recordings will be collected using 64-channel extracellular electrode probes targeted to the mouse hippocampus. Data will include both raw extracellular voltage recordings and processed spike time data. The estimated data volume to be shared is 100–1000 GB.

Behavioral data: Spatial navigation will be recorded concurrently with electrophysiological activity. These data include raw video frames of freely moving mice within an arena, along with processed positional and heading data for each frame. The estimated data volume is 10–100 GB.

Imaging data: Confocal microscopy will be used to capture 3-color image stacks of immunostained mouse brain tissue, verifying probe placement in the hippocampus. The estimated data volume is 1–10 GB.

This study will generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data derived from the human blood samples 
of 3,200 non-Hispanic White (NHW) cases with Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) and matched 
controls. This project will also generate GWAS and exome sequencing data using additional blood 
samples from diverse populations: 1,000 African American (AA) cases and matched controls, 1,343 
Hispanic (HI) cases and matched controls. Familial WGS will be completed in 1,012 NHW and HI, 
respectively. Estimated total data size is 30 TB. Associated phenotypic data (i.e., clinical subtypes, 
endophenotypes, and biomarkers) will also be shared.

The proposed work will not collect new data. This project will perform secondary analysis using publicly 
available data (accessible via the Health and Retirement Study) and data that are accessible through a 
data use agreement (Health and Retirement Study-linked Medicare data).

The proposed work will generate raw video, activity, and cardiac physiological files from which behavioral 
data and autonomic nervous system reactivity data will be generated. Data will be generated for N=500 
subjects across multiple test points

The proposed project involves administering an additional wave of data collection for a longitudinal study. 
Data to be generated include social, behavioral, and biological data collected through web-surveys, in_x0002_person interviews, and home health exams. Approximately 13,000 web-surveys and interviews and 200 
home health exams will be completed.

Summarize the types and estimated amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project.
Clinical data will be obtained from electronic health records (EHR) for ~15,000 patients in a primary care 
clinic. Clinical data include demographic data, medical history, laboratory data, medications, physical 
exams, and cognitive exams. Cognitive assessment data for a subset of individuals (~40) will be collected 
via validated assessment instruments. This project proposes to use clinical data to generate cognitive risk 
scores

Type of study: Interventional, Clinical Trial. A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-Blind 
Study of 180 mother-infant pairs in patients with early onset preeclampsia with primary outcome: days 
of maintaining pregnancy.
360 participants (3 sites) will be enrolled in the study upon diagnosis of preeclampsia but not beyond 34 
weeks gestational age. The subjects will be followed during antepartum management and assigned to 
either the treatment or placebo groups. Infants will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months of 
age. 
Clinical and laboratory data
Includes medical history, demographic information, and patient characteristics at time of enrollment. 
Other data will be extracted from each subsequent clinical encounter leading to delivery, this includes 
lab tests consistent with clinical management, physical exams (presence of headache, swelling, vision 
issues, etc), and blood pressure measurements. Fetal monitoring will include assessments of estimated 
fetal weight, and non-stress tests. Blood and urine will be collected at each visit to generate research 
laboratory data including results of urinalysis (proteinuria/creatinine ratio), analysis of angiogenic 
factors, uric acid, and glycemia. Pregnancy duration (prolongation days of pregnancy) and neonatal 
outcomes (birth weight, Apgar scores, head and chest circumference at birth, short term prognosis of 
neonate, NICU admission) will also be recorded.
Infant follow-up studies will include anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopment 
assessments such as the Bayley scale of infant development at 3, 6, and 12 months. 
These values will be reported as tabular data and stored in a REDCap secure electronic data capture 
system.
Clinical imaging 
2D images generated from Doppler studies of uterine, umbilical and middle cerebral arteries will be 
collected and deidentified raw images will be stored as .jpeg files. The presence of uterine artery 
notching will also be recorded. The pulsatility index for each image will be extracted as tabular data and 
stored in .csv files.
3D images of the fetal thigh will be obtained and stored as deidentified .vol files. These images will then 
be used to measure total thigh, lean mass, and subcutaneous fat volumes. Volume measurement will 
be stored in .csv files.
Real-time grayscale 2D clips of the fetal heart will be acquired to measure global sphericity and cardiac 
area percentile. Deidentified DICOM files of raw data and .csv files of cardiac measurements and 
percentiles will be stored.

Data to be generated from this project include physical activity data from an accelerometer, responses to a 
survey characterizing caregiver well-being, and participant responses to semi-structured interviews 
captured via digital recordings. We will collect data from 250 participants across three timepoints.

This project will perform secondary data analysis on kidney magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to determine the parenchymal kidney 
volume. Analysis will be done on the subjects with available imaging data within the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The 
following dataset will be produced during this project: 
• Clinical dataset of the estimated kidney volume.

Survey This study will collect quantitative and qualitative survey data from 3,000 U.S. adults. The survey instrument
will include 40-50 fixed-scale and open-ended text items including novel measures, scales identified in the PhenX 
toolkit, and two proprietary measures from [insert entity]. Raw and recoded data including open-ended text responses 
and resulting recoded variables will be produced. Open-ended text items will not request personally identifying or 
sensitive information but will be reviewed for privacy disclosure risks and redacted accordingly.
2. Interviews This study will also conduct digitally recorded semi-structured interviews with patients (n=40), healthcare 
providers (n=40) and industry professionals (n=20). Deidentified, raw transcripts will be generated and coded using 
methods described in Aim 2. Codebooks will be developed and used for coding transcripts, as described in Aim 2. 
Codebooks and coding summary files will be shared as detailed below.

As detailed in the Research Strategy Section, we propose the generation of a spatially mapped single-cell atlas 
of the developing mouse brain and include specific deliverables. Our primary deliverable for each modality will be 
a matrix of cells × (counts in peaks for ATAC, UMIs in genes for RNA, or methylation status for DNAm) along with 
a dense metadata table with information for each cell. This includes the animal sex, developmental time point, 
punch of origin with x,y,z coordinates, assigned cluster and inferred cell type, assigned subcluster and inferred 
cell type, as well as a number of QC metrics (total reads, passing reads, reads in peaks, TSS enrichment, cell 
barcode combination, date of preparation for each stage, sequencing platform, likelihood of being a doublet, and 
any other relevant metrics that arise during the project). 
The amount and type of data from human cells will depend on the results from the mouse studies. Data sharing 
plans will be updated when appropriate (likely at the start of year 4 of the grant award).

The data to be shared will include MRI images and clinical assessments from human research participants. This 
application is focused on secondary data analysis from existing data but will also deposit privately held data to a 
public repository. The existing data is available from the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) in collections 2134 (148 
subjects) and 2433 (47 subjects). In addition, we have data from a previous study involving 155 research 
participants with major depressive disorder that have not yet been shared with the research community but will 
be uploaded to NDA during the second quarter of the first year of funding. As discussed in the application, 
structural MRI scans are available for time points before and after treatment along with relevant clinical data.

1000 participants will be enrolled in the study. Clinical data will be obtained from the site electronic 
health record. Clinical data include demographical data, insurance status, medical history, medications, 
lab tests performed by the clinical site and central laboratory, and physical exams data, among other 
data pertinent to the study. Clinical data will be collected at varying frequencies (daily for up to 2 weeks 
then monthly for up to 12 months following informed consent). Research laboratory data include results 
of cytokine analysis and other immunoassays from biospecimens.
Clinical and laboratory data will be captured by each site into the REDCap secure electronic data 
capture system (EDC). Each user will be given role specific access to the EDC, and access will be 
controlled by granting users individual usernames and passwords. Research-specific labs will be 
recorded into the Central lab’s database and merged with the final individual level data for the study 
prior to submitting to NICHD DASH. Clinical data from case report forms will be preserved and shared. 
Clinical data will be collected at varying frequencies (daily for up to 2 weeks then monthly for up to 12 
months following informed consent).
Genomic data will be individual level data. Analysis of genomic DNA will link genotype to phenotypic 
information obtained as part of this study. Genomic data will include Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), 
shallow Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), DNA methylation arrays (EPIC) for a total of 10 TB data. 
Genomic data will be obtained from a single blood draw taken on the first study visit following informed 
consent.

Approximately 100 wild types and 100 phox2bb:mNeonGreen reporter transgenic fish embryos will be 
used for experiments generating scientific data.
Whole mount in situ hybridization will be performed on phox2bb:mNeonGreen zebrafish embryos for 
genes of interest using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes. In situ hybridization data will be 
collected, managed, and analyzed as .png and .jpeg files.
Transcriptional profiling will be assessed from NeonGreen labeled cells using bulk RNA-seq analysis, 
single cell clustering and expression analysis, and/or single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Detailed cisregulatory and open chromatin analysis data will be generated from single cell ATAC-seq. Raw bulk 
and/or scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data will be collected as fastq files. Standard workflows will be used 
to transform the bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq fastq files to matrices and bed files as is 
usual practice.

Our genomic study will be registered with dbGaP, and our raw whole genome sequencing data and derived data 
will be submitted to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Phenotypic and clinical data for all 500 research subjects will 
be collected and deposited in NDA using the data dictionaries available in NDA (described below).

This study will collect renal dialysis data from multiple clinics. Demographic, laboratory results, clinical observations, 
and clinical disposition will be acquired from 250 affected participants and 250 matched healthy controls

The proposed research project will generate multiple types of scientific data across genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical domains. The expected data types and their respective sources are outlined below:

Array-derived genotype data will be collected from human participants using the Illumina platform. This dataset will include genetic information from approximately 1,000 research participants, including 500 cases and 500 controls, through prospective enrollment.

30x whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will also be generated for the same participant cohort, using high-coverage sequencing methods on the Illumina platform.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data will be obtained to analyze gene expression profiles from the same individuals, using the same platform and prospective sample collection.

Hi-C WGS data, which provides information on 3D genomic structure, will be collected using whole-genome sequencing techniques from the same cohort.

Phenotypic and clinical data will be retrieved from institutional electronic health records (EHRs), offering rich, real-world clinical insights associated with the research participants.

Demographic data, including age, sex, ethnicity, and other relevant information, will also be extracted from the EHR system to support stratified analysis and subgroup comparisons.

The proposed project will generate high-throughput sequencing data from 20 human cell lines, obtained from BIOBANK X, using technologies developed by Small Business X Technology. The types and expected quantities of data include:

Nanopore sequence data: Long-read sequencing data will be produced for all 20 human cell lines using Oxford Nanopore technology, enabling structural variant detection and improved genome assembly.

30x whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data: High-coverage short-read sequencing will be performed on the same 20 cell lines to generate comprehensive genomic variant data.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data: Transcriptomic profiling will be conducted on all cell lines to capture gene expression dynamics and support integrative omics analyses.

This project will produce clinical measures, phenotypic characteristics, microscopic imaging, and transcriptomic gene expression profiles from 
mouse models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data will be collected for up to 50 mice 
generating a total of three datasets. The following data files will be produced during the course of this project: 
• Clinical and Phenotypic data including animal sex, body weight, specific organ weights, age and developmental stage, tissue profiled,
and disease outcome.
• RNA sequencing datasets including normalized transcript and gene level expression counts. This dataset will also include a number of 
quality control metrics including total reads, clipped reads, sequencing platform, and any other relevant metrics that arise during the 
project. 
• Light and confocal microscopy images of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slices.

This study will provide nationally representative cross-sectional data on a target sample of 2,500 
children aged 8–17 years and 1,500 primary caregivers (typically one of the child’s parents). 
The data will include survey interviews with the children and their primary caregivers as well as child 
time diaries. 
In addition, the project will recode raw interview data and time diaries to characterize missing values, 
for top coding or collapsing variable categories, or other activities as needed. The project will create 
scale composites from recoded interview data and individual-level links to detailed school data from the 
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and to contextual data based on geocodes for the 
family’s place of residence.

From the proposed additional wave of data collection, we will share social, behavioral, and biological 
data via a tiered access plan determined by sensitivity of data as described in Element 5.

Raw data files will be shared. Data sets will consist of quantitative measures forming the basis of 
primary data analyses.

The proposed work is a secondary data analysis of available data. No new data will be collected from 
this project.

De-identified survey responses and raw accelerometer data will be shared. Individual-level digital 
recordings will not be shared publicly because of the difficulty masking the identity of participants. 
Digital recordings may be shared under a data-use agreement. Similarly, qualitative data from 
participant interviews will be de-identified prior to sharing under a data use agreement.

Genomic data subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy, i.e., raw genomic sequencing 
data and sequencer data files, will be shared along with clinical and phenotypic data needed to 
reproduce any research findings (significant and non-significant).

All individual-level clinical and laboratory data will be preserved and made broadly available to the 
scientific community. Recruitment progress and final results will be documented at ClinicalTrials.gov. It 
is our mission to ensure dissemination of clinical results of sufficient quality to validate and replicate 
research findings.

The scientific data types mentioned above will be shared with protocols and metadata according to 
repository requirements so that they can be reproduced by other researchers and/or generate new 
hypotheses. Types of files that will be generated include, but will not be limited to, *.docs, *.xls, *.pdf, *.cdx, 
*.mol). Specifically, chemical structures, synthesis workflow, and analytical chemistry will be uploaded as 
PDF files. Medicinal and analytical chemistry measurements will be processed and shared on 
spreadsheets and as graphs. For histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments, we will 
preserve images and process and summarize the data on spreadsheets and graphs. PET imaging will be 
shared as PET/CT images.

All the scientific data (and accompanying metadata described in 1.C.) will be preserved and shared. These data will complement existing whole-genome data that are available from the HeLa cell line maintained in dbGaP.

No new data will be collected for this study. All derived data, including atlases, codes, pipelines, and 
trajectories generated by the secondary analysis, will be shared through the respective repositories.

De-identified summary measures such as risk scores and assessment outcomes will be made openly 
available. De-identified individual level data will be available through a controlled access plan 
requiring a confidentiality agreement and institutional approval as described in Element 5 of this DMS 
Plan.

We will share all data generated during the project period except any data generated during protocol 
optimization and/or training of lab personnel that do not meet NIH’s definition of scientific data (i.e., data 
that are not of “sufficient quality to validate or replicate research findings”).

All subject-level clinical, laboratory, and clinical imaging data described in 1A will be preserved and 
shared. Shared data, including ultrasound images, will be deidentified, and original data will be 
maintained at the investigator’s institution. 
Recruitment progress and final results will be documented at clinicaltrials.gov.

1) The raw images or texts of original SM posts will not be shared due to third party 
vendor restrictions and for user privacy protection. The queries and search process, 
as well as a select number of exemplary posts and codebooks (including 
variable/data dictionary for each variable) will be shared. Summary data containing 
post identifiers and associated coded characteristics (e.g. content, sentiment, 
accuracy), which will be used to complete the aims of the study, will be shared.
2) De-identified survey data and de-identified and coded program monitoring data
(e.g., number of logins, “likes”, content of posts, other analytics) from intervention 
participants will be shared.

This secondary data analysis is not generating new data measurements. The data are already available through the dbGaP. The kidney 
volume dataset produced from the methods developed during this study will be made available for further research.

Survey Data: Except where mentioned in Section 5 below, de-identified individual and aggregate survey data (including 
raw and recoded data) will be shared. The de-identification process will remove direct and indirect respondent identifiers. 
Once data are confirmed final, respondent identifiers will be deleted.
Interview Data: Following generation and quality check of raw transcripts from interviews, digital voice recordings will be 
permanently deleted to protect participant privacy. Respondent identifiers will not be shared. Raw transcripts will be 
maintained but not shared. Transcripts from interviews with patients and healthcare providers will be de-identified and 
sensitive content redacted where identification is plausible. These de-identified and redacted transcripts and coding 
summaries will be shared. Transcripts from industry stakeholder interviews will not be shared to protect participant 
privacy (see 5A). All shared data sets mentioned above, and metadata (see below) will be made publicly available 
through the Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)

All raw and processed genomics files and all clinical and phenotypic data will be shared.

The data described in section A will allow researchers to reproduce our publications and will allow them to collect 
additional data in a similar way to extend our results.

This is a secondary data analysis application, so new data is not being measured. Much of the data is already
available through NDA. Clinical and imaging data from 155 new subjects will be shared.

Clinical data that will be preserved and shared are demographical data, insurance status, medical 
history, medications, lab tests performed by the clinical site and central laboratory, and physical exams 
data, among other data pertinent to the study. Clinical data from case report forms will be preserved 
and shared. Research laboratory data that will be preserved and shared include results of cytokine 
analysis and other immunoassays from biospecimens. Genomic data that will be preserved and shared 
will include WES, shallow WGS, and DNA methylation arrays (EPIC). Clinical data sets will be 
submitted to DASH in .CSV format. Genomic data sets will be provided using FASTQ, CRAM, and VCF 
formats.

Sufficient data from this project will be preserved to enable sharing via NDA data of sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings described in the Aims. NIMH requires data measured from human subjects to be shared using the NDA.

The raw interview data, time-diary data, and data for administrative linkages will be stored within a 
secure computing environment. All direct respondent identifiers (e.g., names and addresses) will be 
removed and maintained in a secure file for future contact purposes. 
All other scientific data (coded interview data, scale composites, time diary recodes, school data, and 
contextual data) will be both preserved and shared. Respondent identifiers will not be shared.

All scientific data including raw/measured and derived data (as described in Section 1A) will be 
preserved and shared, for the purposes of reproducibility and reusability.

Some of the nanopore sequence data generated over the course of this technology development project will be 
preliminary data that doesn’t meet the quality metrics that warrant broad data sharing. As the technology matures, 
and the quality of the sequencing reads improves, we anticipate generating some high-quality genomic data 
(sequencing reads, base modification calls, and variant call files) that would be useful to researchers (e.g., as a 
reference for these newer file types) beyond those involved in this project. These files will therefore be preserved 
and shared. Because of the size of nanopore sequencing files, we will share compressed file types. 
30X whole-genome and RNA-seq data that are generated as controls for our tech dev project will also be shared.

All three datasets described in A will be preserved and shared through public repositories.

Identifiable data will be de-identified prior to repository submission. Participant-level clinical data described in A will 
be preserved through deposition of the data in a controlled access public repository.

Genomic (e.g., sequencing reads and variant call files) and phenotypic/clinical data from this project will be useful 
to researchers beyond those involved in this project and will therefore be preserved and shared. We will share de_x0002_identified patient demographics, genomic and clinical/phenotypic data extracted from medical records that are 
used to substantiate the findings that we publish. In alignment with NHGRI’s expectation to share comprehensive 
phenotypic data, we will also select several (5+) other key phenotypic variables extracted from the medical record 
to provide additional context about the research participants’ health to secondary users to maximize the utility of 
the shared data. 
Data that do not meet quality metrics (e.g., RIN>7, replicate concordance >0.8, FastQC check) will not be 
preserved and shared. HIPAA identifiers will be preserved at our institution but will not be shared.

Metadata will include readme files, codebooks, survey instruments, analysis codes, and other supporting 
documentation.

Protocols, informed consent forms to participate in the trial and for biological sample collection, data 
dictionary, and code book will be shared with the data through the repositories. For data submitted to 
DASH, variable-level metadata will be provided using the DASH Codebook, which is a templated data 
dictionary, and will include details of Common Data Elements, definitions, and standards used for data 
collection and sharing. For data submitted to MIDRC, the data will be mapped to the Medical Imaging 
and Data Resource Center Commons dictionary. Other study-associated documentation including 
image acquisition parameters and image analysis workflow diagrams will also be submitted to MIDRC 
as supplementary files associated with the study to facilitate interpretation of the scientific data.

Briefly list the metadata, other relevant data, and any associated documentation (e.g., study protocols 
and data collection instruments) that will be made accessible to facilitate interpretation of the scientific 
data.

In addition to the subject level data described above, digital research material including but not limited 
to images, spreadsheets, protocols, and analysis scripts will be archived and made available

Phenotype and pedigree data files will be submitted once the data has been cleaned (QA/QC checks), 
de-identified, and is ready for submission to NIAGADS. In accordance with NIAGADS submission 
requirements, phenotype data files will include a data dictionary listing each variable and data type 
description. A column indicating consent level for each subject will also be included and will match the 
consent levels specified on the Institutional Certification.

To ensure proper interpretation, reuse, and reproducibility of the scientific data, comprehensive metadata and documentation will be made available alongside each dataset. General metadata for all data types will include details such as animal strain, sex, date of birth, age at the time of the experiment, laboratory and institution information, and drug treatment status, including concentration and route of administration. For electrophysiology data, additional metadata will capture electrode number and position, reference electrode type and location, equipment models, and recording parameters such as sampling rate and filter cut-offs. Behavioral data will be accompanied by metadata on equipment models (e.g., arena and camera), along with camera specifications including frame rate and resolution. Imaging data will include information on the targeted brain region, magnification, resolution, and color channels used. In addition to these metadata elements, associated documentation such as study protocols, data collection instruments, and standard operating procedures will be provided to support transparency and enable effective data reuse.

In addition to the subject-level data described above, all the data related to Compound A design, 
PK/toxicology, assay development, probe chemistry, and in vivo PET imaging, along with related paradigm 
design and experimental definitions will be included when data are deposited in their respective 
repositories. For example, quality control measurements and protocols, standard curves, instrument 
calibration protocols, names of equipment used (to be included in protocols), and list of reagents, including 
catalog number and provider, especially to reproduce the synthesis of compound A analogs will be shared.

Common Data Elements available via the Disaster Research Response (DR2) Resources Portal and 
the NIH Common Data Elements Repository, as required by the FOA. Genomic data will be in CRAM 
format with alignment to latest reference genome and variant files in VCF format.",### Element 3: Standards:,"Common data standards applied will include those recommended by the NIH for genomic data (e.g., VCF for variant calls) and clinical data (e.g., CDISC standards for clinical trials data). Metadata standards such as ISA-Tab will be used to describe experimental conditions, sample characteristics, and assay details. These standards enable interoperability of datasets and resources, facilitating their integration and analysis across different studies."
Secondary data analysis,element_3,"The data that will be used for some of the proposed secondary data analysis is already in NDA and is formatted 
using NDA data dictionaries. The new data we will deposit will also use existing NDA data dictionaries. Since 
the data set to be deposited into NDA was collected prior to the publication of NOT-MH-20-067, not all of the 
common data elements expected by NIMH are available. However, we will transform some existing demographic 
and clinical data into the formats expected for:
1) Age (ndar_subject01)
2) Sex at Birth (ndar_subject01)
3) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, cde_phq901 NDA data dictionary).
In addition, information from the Beck Depression Inventory will be deposited for all 155 research participants 
using the NDA bdi01 data dictionary. Deposited images will use the NDA image03 data dictionary. Data derived 
from the MRI images will be deposited into NDA using the imagingcollection01 data dictionary.",### Element 3: Standards:,"To enable interoperability of datasets and resources, we will apply common data standards to the scientific data and associated metadata.

The study data will be submitted to a generalist repository that is participating in the NIH Generalist Repository 
Ecosystem Initiative, Vivli. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Central 
Repository currently accepts datasets only from NIDDK-funded, large, multi-site clinical consortia and not R01
studies. No NIH or domain-specific repositories for “renal disease” or “renal dialysis” were found. This study will not 
generate genomics data, so data will not be submitted to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Therefore, a 
generalist repository seems like the most appropriate location to deposit the data.

The primary data repository for this study will be the NHGRI Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space 
(AnVIL). 
Protocols related to donor recruitment, tissue collection/preservation/biobanking, pathology/tissue dissection, 
whole-genome sequencing, and data processing and analysis will also be openly available on the website

dissemination or sharing of raw social media data. No additional limitations apply other 
than the controls and privacy protections described below.

The primary datasets analyzed in this project are publicly available under controlled access and shared 
under the guidelines of their respective repositories (OASIS and BLSA). Individuals interested in accessing 
these datasets should contact the original repository. New variables generated from this secondary 
analysis of the existing dataset will be returned to the BLSA and OASIS data system for sharing through 
their established channels. We will adhere to the respective Data Use Agreements for OASIS and BLSA, 
which prohibit any attempts to re-identify research participants or redistribute primary and secondary 
derived data. We will provide proper attribution to these organizations in any publication or presentation 
of results derived from these datasets and submit the results for review prior to publication.

The NIH-Lacks Family Agreement (Agreement) expects NIH-funded investigators who generate HeLa cell whole genome sequence data (DNA or RNA) to submit those data to NIH through dbGaP to the HeLa cell Genome Sequencing Studies. The data are distributed according to the HeLa Genome Data Use Agreement under Health, Medical, and Biomedical (HMB) purposes. Through the NIH-Lacks Family Agreement, an Institutional Certification with the designated HMB data use limitation has been completed for the HeLa cell Genome Sequencing Studies and is held by dbGaP. No additional Institutional Certification is needed.

If we have an invention for which we intend to seek patent protection, we may request approval to delay 
the sharing of scientific data associated with it until a patent is filed and will update this Plan to reflect any 
approved delays in data sharing beyond expected data sharing timelines. We anticipate that if intellectual 
property is generated, it would be on the methods of synthesis of Compound A analogs and chemical 
structures. To maximize data sharing, we will share the physical properties and use of the Compound A 
analogs, including binding specificity, Kd values, and imaging data without delay.

All research participants will be consented for broad data sharing.

There are no factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data generated by 
this project.

Data will be shared under a two-tier distribution system. All data that can be de-identified will be 
publicly shared. Data with specific confidentially risks, such as individual-level digital recordings will 
not be shared publicly because of the difficulty masking the identity of participants. Data with 
increased risk of reidentification will be shared under a data-use agreement that clearly establish use 
rules to facilitate respondent confidentiality.

Data used for secondary analysis in this project are 1) publicly accessible (e.g., Health and Retirement 
Study), or 2) shared through a restricted use agreement (e.g., Health and Retirement Study-linked 
Medicare Data).

Archived files will be accessible with no limitations. Animal IDs will be replaced with codes. If the 
videos include primate footage that could put the researchers at risk, the videos will only be shared 
with approved users.

Due to the nature of the data that will be collected, and to ensure participant confidentiality, data will 
be made available under a tiered system based on data sensitivity. All tiers of data require a data-use 
agreement at a minimum, additional precautions for restricted-use, high restricted-use, and virtual 
enclave data will be included in the data request forms.

Individual-level data will be shared with controlled access as allowed by informed consent agreements 
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Access to the data will require investigators to register for a dbGaP account and submit an application providing a summary of the 
research you intend to conduct, the dataset you require, and a description of any new data or variables your research will generate. Data 
will then be made available following application approval.

The subitem questions and data making up the two proprietary scales used in the survey cannot be shared due to 
licensing restrictions. However, the computed measures resulting from these scales will be shared.
Sharing qualitative data such as transcriptions from interviews can potentially reveal sensitive information and identify 
individual participants. The potential for identification from interview transcripts is particularly high among industry 
professionals given the small population from which they are recruited and the inclusion of questions regarding 
organization-specific practices. The higher level of redaction needed to remove potentially identifying and sensitive 
information would substantially reduce the utility of transcripts in future analyses. Moreover, our prior experience and the 
attached letters of support indicate that confidentiality would be required for industry stakeholders’ full participation in 
this study. To ensure this group’s participation and honest responses, we will not share transcripts or coding summaries 
from industry stakeholder interviews.
Research participants will receive information about where and how data from this study will be shared during study 
enrollment procedures and in informed consent documents. Interview participants will be informed their data will be 
shared on AnVIL with controlled access for future use (see 5B). Participants who want to withdraw their data from the 
study prior to de-identification may contact the study team or the university’s research administration office (See 5C).

Public Use Data: All deidentified study data that are not designated as restricted use will be made 
available as public use data to the research community via DSDR. Users of the public use data must 
register with ICPSR and agree to the Terms of Use, which are designed to protect study participants by 
limiting data use to scientific research and aggregate statistical reporting, prohibiting attempts to identify 
study participants, and requiring immediate reporting of any disclosure of study participant identity. 
Data users also agree not to share or redistribute any data downloads.
Restricted Access Data: Data that are determined to be potentially identifying through indirect or 
deductive disclosure are provided under restricted data contract to users who demonstrate a valid 
research need and meet conditions of use. These restricted data will include separate files with 
geospatial indicators below the level of state, such as county, census tract, block-group, and block for 
all years; individual-level links to school codes and detailed school data from NCES; and linkages to 
contextual data. Access to restricted study data is available via a virtual data enclave system at 
DSDR/ICPSR. The enclave provides remote access to the specific restricted data components for 
which a user has been approved.

All accessible data will be de-identified and in the case of HIPAA conflicts, a limited data set will be 
created. The institution will determine whether the de-identified individual-level data are subject to the 
NIH Certificate of Confidentiality policy, and if so, will protect accordingly and ensure that recipients of 
the data are aware of the protection.

Participants will be provided a broad consent document [if allowed under IRB review] to facilitate data 
sharing. Data will be de-identified, and the tiered-access plan will provide additional protections for the

data are subject to the NIH Certificate of Confidentiality policy, and if so, will protect accordingly and 
ensure that recipients of the data are aware of the protection.

N/A. No human data will be generated or shared.

No new data will be collected from this project, only analysis of existing data. Data deidentification 
procedures applied to the data of origin ensures that no contact with original respondents is possible.

All direct participant identifiers will be removed from data prior to sharing. Restricted data (I.e., digital 
recordings which cannot be de-identified) will be available through a data use agreement. Study 
participants will be asked to consent to widespread data sharing with the research community based 
upon recommendations of the local IRB and approval of the consent document. The institution will 
determine whether the de-identified individual-level data are subject to the NIH Certificate of 
Confidentiality policy, and if so, will protect accordingly and ensure that recipients of the data are aware 
of the protection.

Not applicable; this project does not involve human research participants.

All data will be de-identified prior to receipt by the repository. Internal study ID numbers and Global 
Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) will be generated separate from personal identifiers. A master key document 
will be securely maintained by the study team connecting participant identifiers to study IDs and will be 
separate from de-identified data. The NIA GUID instance allows researchers to aggregate data from the 
same research participant without different laboratories having to share personally identifiable 
information about that research participant. Personally identifiable information will not be shared. Informed Consent: Participants will be informed that de-identified data will be stored and shared with 
other institutions or companies as approved by a Scientific Review Committee and in accordance with 
all applicable regulations. Written informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the first study 
visit. Potential participants will have discussed the data sharing process for the study over the phone at 
least once in addition to having read recruitment materials and completed screening instruments.

Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality.

For a prospective study like this one, consent procedures will include provision for data sharing to 
maximize the value of the data for wider research use, while providing adequate safeguards for 
participants. As part of the consent process, proposed procedures for data sharing will be set out 
clearly and current and potential future risks associated with this will be explained to research 
participants.
Language informing the participant or legally authorized representative that residual biological 
specimens may be stored in a biorepository for other scientific investigations will be used in the consent 
forms. The informed consents will contain language permitting secondary use with broad data sharing 
under controlled access for general research use through established data repositories such as DASH 
(clinical and laboratory data) and MIDRC (imaging). Patients will be informed that they will not be 
contacted or re-consented for future sharing or accessing data through repositories. 
Privacy and confidentiality protections will be consistent with applicable federal, Tribal, state, and local 
laws, regulations, and policies. 
As the data is collected it will be digitally preserved in our secure institutional cloud storage 
environment and the PI’s computer under strict password access. As this research data includes 
personal data relating to human participants, special measures will be followed to safeguard the 
security of data. We will follow robust policies for managing confidentiality and data security, consistent 
with legal, good practice and NIH policy requirements. This study will be compliant with ISO 27001 IT 
security standards. Our institution is ISO compliant (registration number 2374573.)
Data will be deidentified before sharing in DASH and MIDRC by removing all 18 direct identifiers 
according to HIPAA Privacy Rule’s Safe Harbor.

All human scientific data will be de-identified in accordance with HIPAA and the Common Rule. Data 
will be shared and made available according to the data use limitations stipulated by the participants’ 
informed consent. The investigator will apply for a certificate of confidentiality from NIH.

Data will be de-identified according to HIPAA and the Common Rule. All direct respondent identifiers (e.g., names,
residence, email addresses) will be removed. Interview transcripts will be redacted to remove additional non-standard 
identifiers. Deidentification will be completed prior to the finalization of shared data files. Digitally recorded interviews will be 
deleted following transcription.
Participants will have the opportunity to opt out of sharing during informed consent procedures. Once personally identifying 
information are removed from the data set and deleted, we will not be able to identify data associated with a specific 
research participant for removal from the dataset. Limited provisions for participants’ withdrawal of data from sharing 
protocols will be outlined in informed consent.
Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality

Once the fieldwork data collection for this study has concluded, all direct respondent identifiers (e.g., 
names and addresses) will be removed and maintained in a separate control file for future contact 
purposes. Participants’ identifying information is only accessed by approved staff as part of the project 
duties within a secure computing environment. Linkages to detailed school data from NCES are based 
on a school directory look-up that occurs as part of the interview. Geocoding and linkage to contextual 
information will be done following data collection. Deidentification will be completed by the end of data 
processing, prior to the finalization of the public use and restricted data files.
Study respondents will be asked to consent to data collection and sharing with the wider research 
community. 
The privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human subject participants in this study will be protected 
through the suppression of all direct respondent identifiers, the careful classification of any potentially 
identifying data as restricted access, the high security standards through which the DSDR/ICPSR 
virtual data enclave provides access to restricted data for approved researchers, and the project’s 
Certificate of Confidentiality.

No human samples or research participants will be used in this study.

Only genomic data will be shared; we are not obtaining demographic or phenotypic information from BIOBANK X.
Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality.

Data will be de-identified according to HIPAA and the Common Rule. Participants will have the opportunity [to opt_x0002_out of such sharing] or to withdraw their data from the database by contacting the study team or the university’s 
research administration office. We will track these preferences closely and respect individual participant wishes.
Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality.

To protect research participants’ privacy and confidentiality, data submitted to the repository will not include 
personally identifiable information such as names or addresses. Additional protections, such as the approach for 
managing Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act identifiers, will be used for de-identification or to 
provide a limited data set to minimize the risk of participant reidentification.

This study involves analyzing existing, de-identified data shared under the guidelines and restrictions of 
OASIS and BLSA repositories. No additional human subject deidentification or consent will be required.

Not applicable as this project does not have human research participants.

Informed consent documents used for the proposed clinical trial will include explicit language informing 
the participant or legally authorized representative that residual biological specimens, including DNA, 
may be stored in a biorepository for other scientific investigations. The informed consents will contain 
language permitting secondary use with broad data sharing under controlled access with general 
research use restrictions in DASH (clinical data) and dbGaP/SRA (genomic data). Patients will not be 
contacted or re-consented for future sharing or accessing data through repositories. 
Privacy and confidentiality protections consistent with applicable federal, Tribal, state, and local laws, 
regulations, and policies will be followed. Data will be deidentified by removing all 18 HIPAA identifiers 
prior to sharing, and the study will have a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH

The NDA GUID tool allows researchers to aggregate data from the same research participant without different 
laboratories having to share personally identifiable information about that research participant. The NDA data 
dictionaries do not permit personally identifiable information to be shared. NDA maintains a Certificate of 
Confidentiality. 
For the 155 participants from our previous study, exact dates have been obscured via the Shift and Truncate 
method [1], which preserves within-case temporal relations.

The data are deidentified, and there is data access committee (see 5B) that is used by NeMO to evaluate the 
proposed use of the sensitive data from human subjects. The data archives which will hold the data are funded 
by NIH, so they have a Certificate of Confidentiality.

oversee data collection, analysis, storage, and sharing. Compliance with the plan will be monitored by 
the PI routinely. The PI will conduct monthly meetings with key study personnel to ensure the timeliness 
of data entry and will review data to ensure quality of data entry. The PI will ensure data are submitted 
and shared according to this DMSP",### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:,"Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study's Principal Investigator in collaboration with the institution's data management and compliance offices. Regular oversight meetings (at least quarterly) will ensure that data collection, storage, sharing, and protection practices adhere to the plan and all relevant regulations and guidelines."
Genomic data from a non-human source,element_6,"The Office of Sponsored Programs at University X that will be administering this award has created a data 
management and sharing plan compliance system as part of their process for submitting the annual NIH progress 
report. That Office will be monitoring submission of data to NEMO. 
Validation Schedule (this section is required by NIMH)
Data will be validated using the existing pipelines at NeMO. We will submit each dataset once we reach a 
specific data freeze milestone. Upon each data freeze we will perform an initial phase of analysis that will 
culminate in the production of the cell × property matrix and associated metadata, at which point the dataset will 
be released. 
These milestones and target timelines include: 
End of 1st quarter of year 2: A full spatial single-cell ATAC-seq map of an entire mouse brain at P14. 
End of 4th quarter of year 2: An accompanying spatially-mapped single-cell RNA-seq dataset for a full mouse 
brain at P14, integrated with the ATAC dataset. 
End of 2nd quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell ATAC-seq map of each time point. 
End of 2nd quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell DNA methylation map for P14, integrated with RNA and 
ATAC datasets. 
End of 4th quarter of year 3: The complete spatial single-cell RNA-seq dataset for all time points, integrated with 
the ATAC data. 
End of 4th quarter of year 3: A full spatial single-cell map for all modalities, ATAC, RNA, and DNA methylation, 
integrated across modalities.",### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:,"Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the project's Principal Investigator (PI), in collaboration with the institution's Office of Research Compliance and the designated Data Manager. Regular reviews (at least annually) will ensure that all data are properly archived, shared according to the plan, and that any updates or changes to the plan are appropriately documented and communicated to NIH. The PI will be responsible for reporting on plan compliance as part of progress reports and will work closely with the research team to address any issues or concerns related to data management and sharing."
Human genomic data,element_6,"The Office of Sponsored Programs at University X that will be administering this award has created a data 
management and sharing plan compliance system as part of their process for submitting the annual NIH progress 
report. That Office is collecting information related to the number of research participants whose data are 
deposited each reporting year. The Office will check that the recruiting totals reported in the progress report are 
consistent with the data that has been deposited into AnVIL or consistent with most up to date recruitment 
numbers. The Office of Sponsored Programs will look for the AnVIL data DOIs when publications occur and will 
include that information in the annual progress report.",### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:,"Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the institution's data management oversight committee, which includes representatives from the research team, the Office of Research Compliance, and the Library's Data Services. Regular reviews (at least bi-annually) will ensure adherence to the plan, address any emerging issues or changes in policies, and confirm that all shared data are properly documented and accessible according to the stated timelines."
