Ravi Ravichandran, Program Director at NIDDK, initially worked on developing a ChatGPT-based DMSP tool for researchers but later shifted his focus to building an evaluation tool for NIH program officers. I have seen examples where this tool generates element-specific evaluation scores and action items, which is promising. Many NIH program officers are not deeply familiar with all six DMSP elements, so such tools could help level the field and ensure fair, consistent evaluations. In this context, DMPTool is well positioned to support researchers directly by offering an AI-enabled assistant to help them draft strong DMSPs.","2025-09-07 19:23:01.753","2025-09-07 19:23:01.753"
